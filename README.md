                                               This repository serves 2 main purposes:
                                               1. This repository demonstrates my homelab work and my desire to learn and apply Linux system administartion skills
                                               2. This repository wil serve as a knowledge base for myself. If I ever forget how to perform a certain task I can refer to labs in this repository
